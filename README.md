 # Project 4 - Inhabitent Camping Supply Co. Website
  
 Utilizing WordPress, PHP, SCSS, and HTML, I have created a custom WordPress theme for the Inhabitent Camping Supply Co. website. 
 
 The site contains blog posts, product descriptions, a custom homepage, an about page, and a find us page.
 

 ## Take aways
  
 This opportunity was integral in the further development of my project planning and SCSS architecture. During the process and consequent revelations, I found it essential to take steps back--reaccess progress and ensuing issues--to move forward once again.
